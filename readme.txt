== Description ==

Customer Manager plugin for Wordpress is a professional tool for not only keeping e-commerce records but using them to give customers the best service after sale. There is an admin
side to the plugin and a customer side however administrations also have their own customer pages. So far it includes a ticket
service and ability to assign products to customers accounts, giving them access to that product. If you use eStore there is an intigration option to import products and
customers from this great shopping cart. Wordpress profiles will automatically be created for each new eStore customer imported.
